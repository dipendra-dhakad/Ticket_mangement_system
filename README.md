Node.js (v12 or higher)
MongoDB (either local or cloud-based via MongoDB Atlas)


Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd ticket
3. Install Dependencies
Install the project dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Create a .env File
In the root directory of your project, create a .env file and add the following content:

env
Copy code
MONGO_URI=<Your MongoDB URI>
PORT=5000
Replace <Your MongoDB URI> with your MongoDB connection string.
For local MongoDB, it might be something like mongodb://localhost:27017/ticket-management.
For MongoDB Atlas, it will be a URL provided by Atlas.
4. Run the Application
You can run the app using:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Or, if you're using nodemon for automatic restarting on code changes, use:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
The server should be running on http://localhost:5000 (or another port if specified in .env).

5. Testing the API
